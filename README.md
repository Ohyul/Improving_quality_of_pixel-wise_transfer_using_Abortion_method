# Improving_quality_of_pixel-wise_transfer_using_Abortion_method

This paper proposes a more efficient E2Style model using the abortion method. In the training process, 
we exclude inefficient iterations by prompting an abortion upon meeting certain conditions. 
This novel approach has proven effective in addressing the issue of overfitting and improves upon other aspects by comparing previous models.
